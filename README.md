# Group Expense Calculator

When I first started learning web development, I was looking for a project that would not only challenge me but also solve a real-world problem. My instructor advised me to develop something that addresses a specific issue, and soon after, I encountered a situation that sparked the idea for this project.

Imagine this: you're out with friends, and the evening involves a variety of expenses—some people drink alcohol, others don't; some eat meat, while others avoid it. One person pays for the venue, another does the shopping for everyone. As the night winds down, the inevitable question arises: how do we fairly split the bill? It was this exact scenario that inspired me to create a **Group Expense Calculator**—a simple, intuitive tool designed to make dividing costs among friends easy and transparent.

### Features

- **Participants Section**: Add all group members involved in the expense-sharing.
- **Items Section**: List all the items purchased, assign who used each item, and specify who paid for it. This allows for flexibility in handling situations where multiple people contribute to different purchases.
- **Summary Section**: View a detailed breakdown of how much each person owes, with options to send personalized payment requests or a group message.
- **Language and Currency Options**: The calculator supports both Hebrew and English, offering a convenient choice for users. Additionally, it allows calculations in multiple currencies including USD, ILS (Shekel), and EUR, providing further flexibility.

### Technical Details

- **100% AI-Driven Development**: The entire site was created without writing a single line of code manually. From the initial concept to the final product, AI tools guided every step of the way.
- **AI-Powered Prompts**: The prompts used to develop the site and the suggestions for improvements were all generated by AI.

### Payment Simplification

The calculator simplifies payments by centralizing all transfers. Each participant sends their due amount to the person who paid the most, and that person then redistributes the funds to others who made payments. This reduces the number of transactions needed, ensuring that each participant only needs to make one transfer, streamlining the entire process.

### Getting Started

Since this project is a simple HTML file, no installation is required. To use the calculator, simply open the HTML file in your web browser, and you're ready to go!

### Usage Instructions

1. **Add Participants**: Start by adding the names of all participants involved in the expenses.
2. **Add Items**: List all items purchased, including the cost, and select which participants used each item. Specify who paid for each item to ensure accurate calculations.
3. **View Summary**: The summary section provides a breakdown of how much each person owes or is owed, including options to share personalized payment requests or a group message with the totals.

### Contributing

While there's no need for direct contributions to the project, I am happy to receive suggestions for improvements or optimizations. The project was created to solve a personal problem that I and my friends encountered, and any feedback to make it better is greatly appreciated.
